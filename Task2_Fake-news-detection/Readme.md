## 1. Project overview

Fake News Detection aims to classify news text into **Real** or **Fake** categories. The project explores traditional ML baselines and deep learning (LSTM) to compare performance. It is intended as a learning project and a portfolio piece demonstrating NLP pipelines, model-building, evaluation and visualization.

**Use cases:** content moderation, news verification tools, social media monitoring, research into misinformation.

## 2. Features

* Data cleaning & preprocessing (text normalization, stopword removal, tokenization)
* Text vectorization options: TF-IDF and token embedding for deep models
* Traditional classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) for baselines
* LSTM-based neural network for sequence modelling
* Model training, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation
* Evaluation: confusion matrix, classification report (precision/recall/F1), ROC-AUC
* Visualizations: training history plots, ROC curve, word clouds for each class
* Jupyter notebook with fully commented cells to reproduce the experiments

---

## 6. How to run (step-by-step)

1. **Data inspection**: open `data/train.csv` with pandas and inspect columns (e.g., `title`, `text`, `label`).

2. **Preprocessing**: run the preprocessing cell/script which should:

   * Lowercase text
   * Remove punctuation and special characters
   * Remove or handle URLs, HTML tags
   * Tokenize
   * Remove stopwords (optional)
   * Optionally lemmatize or stem

3. **Feature extraction**:

   * For classical ML: TF-IDF vectorization (scikit-learn `TfidfVectorizer`)
   * For LSTM: Tokenize with `keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer`, create padded sequences with `pad_sequences`, and prepare embedding layer input (if using pretrained embeddings).

4. **Train models**:

   * Baselines: train Logistic Regression / RandomForest / SVM. Use `train_test_split` or cross-validation.
   * LSTM: compile and fit the network. Save training history for plots.

5. **Evaluate**: produce confusion matrix, classification report, ROC curve and AUC.

6. **Visualize**: draw wordclouds for words in real vs fake news, plot training/validation loss and accuracy for LSTM.

7. **Save models/outputs**: save trained models (`.h5` for Keras, `.joblib` for sklearn), and save plots to `outputs/`.

---

## 7. Dataset (source & format)

* Example columns commonly used:

  * `title` — article headline
  * `text` — full article content
  * `label` — 0/1 or `REAL`/`FAKE`

**Notes:**

* Ensure there is no data leakage: shuffle and split by article, not by sentence.
* If using multiple datasets, harmonize labels and columns before merging.

---

## 8. Detailed pipeline (what each file/notebook cell does)

**notebooks/Fake\_news\_detection.ipynb** — a single notebook that contains the full pipeline. Typical sections:

1. Import libraries & set random seed
2. Load dataset(s)
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (class distribution, word counts, sample texts)
4. Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenizing, stopword removal)
5. Visualizations (wordclouds, histograms, top n words)
6. Feature engineering (TF-IDF, tokenization for sequences)
7. Model building (sklearn models + Keras LSTM)
8. Model training & hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV or manual tuning)
9. Evaluation (confusion matrix, classification report, ROC, AUC)
10. Save trained models and outputs

If you have helper scripts under `src/`, explain briefly what each does (e.g., `preprocess.py` contains `clean_text()` and `tokenize()` functions).

## 9. Model(s) used & explanation

### LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

**What is LSTM?**
LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to remember long-term dependencies in sequences and mitigate the vanishing/exploding gradient problems of vanilla RNNs. It uses internal gating mechanisms (input, forget, output gates) to control information flow.

**Why use LSTM for fake news detection?**
News articles are sequences of words where the context matters. LSTM can capture word order and dependencies better than bag-of-words approaches.

**Typical LSTM architecture used in the notebook**

* Embedding layer (optionally initialized with pretrained word vectors)
* 1 or 2 LSTM layers (units: e.g., 64 or 128)
* Dropout between layers
* Dense output layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification

**Key hyperparameters explained:**

* `epochs`: number of passes through the full dataset. Typical values: 5–50 depending on dataset size. More epochs increase risk of overfitting; monitor validation loss.
* `batch_size`: number of samples per gradient update (e.g., 32, 64)
* `learning_rate`: optimization step size (used by Adam or other optimizers)
* `embedding_dim`: size of word vectors (e.g., 100, 200)
* `max_sequence_length`: length to which sequences are padded/truncated

**Loss & metrics**

* Loss: `binary_crossentropy` (since binary classification)
* Metrics: `accuracy`, and track `val_loss` and `val_accuracy` for overfitting/underfitting

---

## 10. Visualizations & interpretation

**Confusion matrix**

* A 2x2 matrix showing True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), True Negatives (TN), False Negatives (FN).
* Interpretation examples:

  * High FP means the model flags many real articles as fake — may cause false alarms.
  * High FN means the model misses fake news — dangerous for moderation.

**Classification report**

* Shows precision, recall and F1-score for each class.

  * **Precision** = TP / (TP + FP) — how many predicted fake are actually fake.
  * **Recall (Sensitivity)** = TP / (TP + FN) — how many actual fake examples were detected.
  * **F1-score** = 2 \* (precision \* recall) / (precision + recall)

**ROC curve & AUC**

* ROC plots True Positive Rate vs False Positive Rate for different classification thresholds.
* AUC (Area Under Curve) summarizes performance across thresholds: 1.0 is perfect, 0.5 is random.

**Word clouds**

* Visualize most frequent tokens for each class (useful for qualitative inspection).
* Be careful: stopwords and common named entities can bias interpretation — filter or normalize before generating.

**Training history plots (LSTM)**

* Plot training & validation loss/accuracy vs epochs to diagnose overfitting.

  * If training loss keeps decreasing while validation loss rises → overfitting
  * If both losses plateau or are high → underfitting

## 11. Evaluation metrics and sample results

Include the final metrics you obtained (replace these sample numbers with your actual results):

```
Accuracy: 0.91
Precision (Fake): 0.89
Recall (Fake): 0.86
F1-score (Fake): 0.875
ROC-AUC: 0.94
```

**Remember**: Always report metrics on a held-out test set that the model never saw during training or hyperparameter tuning.

---

## 12. Reproducibility & tips for experimentation

* Set random seeds for numpy, tensorflow/keras and scikit-learn for reproducible runs.
* Save tokenizer and vectorizers used to prepare text (e.g., `tokenizer.pickle`, `tfidf_vectorizer.joblib`).
* Save model weights with timestamps and hyperparameters in filename.
* Use `ModelCheckpoint` and `EarlyStopping` callbacks for LSTM training to save the best model and avoid overfitting.

Example callback usage in Keras:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint
es = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=3, restore_best_weights=True)
mc = ModelCheckpoint('saved_models/best_lstm.h5', monitor='val_loss', save_best_only=True)
model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_val, y_val), epochs=20, callbacks=[es, mc])
```

**Hyperparameter search tips:**

* Search over `embedding_dim`, `lstm_units`, `dropout_rate`, `batch_size`, and `learning_rate`.
* Use a validation split or cross-validation for classical models.

---

## 13. Known issues & limitations

* Models can pick up topical or source biases — be careful when using models across time periods or domains.
* LSTMs can be slower and need more data compared to classical methods. Consider Transformer-based models (BERT) for better performance on smaller datasets.
* Wordclouds and top-word lists can be misleading if proper normalization or stopword filtering is not applied.

---

## 14. Future work

* Try pretrained transformer models (e.g., BERT, DistilBERT) via Hugging Face — typically much better at contextual understanding.
* Build a lightweight API (Flask/FastAPI) to serve predictions.
* Add explainability (LIME/SHAP) to inspect why the model makes decisions.
* Add more robust data collection and debiasing techniques.
